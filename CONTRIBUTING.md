# Contributing Policy
If you are interested in contributing to the codebase, you must adhere to the following guidelines:
- Open an ``Issue`` to discuss what changes you'd like to make (do **not** make a ``Pull Request`` without discussing it first)
- If approved by a *Project Manager*, we'd be interested in integrating the feature into the codebase
  - Keep in mind that even if we don't see the need for the feature, you're more than welcome (per our license) to fork the repository and write your own version
- After writing the code, you can make a ``Pull Request``
- If approved, your code will be automatically integrated into the program, and distributed the following release cycle
- The following stipulations apply:
  - **No** guarentee is made regarding the approval of a ``Pull Request``, regardless of whether or not the ``Issue`` was initially approved
  - **No** guarentee is made that explicit credit will be given in the program itself (all contributers are auto-added to the [contributors section](https://github.com/http-samc/cut-it/graphs/contributors))
  - *The Project Managers* reserve the right to reject any pull request **for any reason, with or without explanation**
  - ***Any and every instance of homophobia, racism, sexism, or another practice deemed offensive by the Project Managers will immediately result in a ban on your ability to contribute to the codebase.***
