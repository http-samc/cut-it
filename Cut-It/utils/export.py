    world are grieving with all of the families who are living through this unthinkable tragedy," she said.Search and rescue efforts to find survivors amid the rubble of the building have become increasingly grim. Miami-Dade Fire Chief Alan Cominsky said Wednesday that search and rescue personnel combing the rubble have found no evidence that anyone survived the initial collapse.A day earlier, he said there had been no signs of any voids or livable spaces amid the wreckage where people might have survived."We're definitely searching," he said. "We're not coming across that."Read MoreOn Wednesday afternoon, a group
    of collapse survivors gathered at a local hotel to receive a multiple police vehicle escort back to the collapse site. The cluster of survivors gathered in the lobby of the hotel, being advised by uniformed police offers, officers in plain clothes, red cross workers and what appeared to be grief counselors.A woman in her sixties said she was heading back to the Champlain South collapse site. "I'm just sad, but I want to see it," she told CNN.The search continued Wednesday through inclement weather from Tropical Storm Elsa, which passed by the opposite coast of Florida. Winds of up to 30 miles per hour walloped
    crews Tuesday, but the weather had largely cleared by midday Wednesday, Cava said.Rescue crews battle storms as they search for dozens still unaccounted for in Florida condo collapseThe condo's collapse has raised questions about whether other residential structures could be at risk in Miami-Dade County, where sea levels are rising, the salty air is corrosive and nearly two-thirds of all commercial, condo and apartment buildings are as old or older than the 40-year-old building that collapsed, according to a CNN analysis of county records.Florida's legal community has created a safety task force to review laws

    Real Property, Probate, and Trust Law Section of the Florida Bar, according to the statement."The Task Force will serve as a resource to the Governor and Legislature as they review all aspects of Florida condominium law, development, association operations, and maintenance to determine and recommend if legislative and or regulatory changes should be enacted to minimize the likelihood of a similar tragedy," Bob Swain, chairperson of the Florida Bar Real Property, Probate, and Trust Law Section, said in a statement.How to help Surfside VictimsTeams not finding anything positive, but still more space to search Photos: Deadly condo collapse near MiamiRescue crews work at the site of the collapsed building in Surfside, Florida, on Tuesday, July 6.

The key to finding survivors, Cominsky said, is finding voids or livable spaces among the rubble.About 5 million pounds of debris have been removed from the site so far, Cominsky said. But with the amount of ground to cover, there is no telling what the teams will find in the coming days,
    Cominsky said.The site has been broken up into grids, none of which have been fully cleared yet.

Balboa was not in the building but was standing nearby when it collapsed. Balboa said Jonah's uncle told him Jonah was out of the
    hospital with only minor injuries. Since the collapse, Balboa says he has replayed that moment in his mind many times, wondering what he could have done differently to save more people, he said. Four additional bodies were recovered Tuesday, Levine Cava said. The victims of the collapse range in age from 4 to 92.With rescue efforts still underway, some families have asked to visit the collapse site, Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett said."Of course, we have to work around the rescue efforts," he said. "I think it would be very, very good for those families to again see the amazing efforts that are being expended on their behalf." Debris held for investigationSearch and rescue teams continue to work in the rubble at the site of the collapsed Champlain Towers South condo in Surfside.Meanwhile, more federal organizations are investigating why the building collapsed. Mayor Levine Cava said the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the US Geological Survey and the National Science Foundation are sending staff."NIST, our federal partner, continues to work closely with the structural specialists, with detectives, and the fire rescue crews on site, as the evidence gathering process is well underway," she said."They're capturing all possible insights from the debris and all evidence is being properly tagged and logged."'Tragedy beyond tragedy': Champlain Towers South was a catastrophe in slow motion All of the debris removed from the site is considered "evidentiary debris," Levine Cava said. The remnants are being
    sorted on-site, and any objects that can be distinguished are put in certain bins and labeled as to their exact location, the mayor said.The county has created a form for family members to document their belongings, which will be an active part of the investigation, Levine Cava said."The families are not reviewing what's come out of the site at this time, but we have photographs, they have their information, and as we move forward, we'll be attempting to do matching and releasing it to them as soon as we can, given the active investigation," she said.CNN's Rosa Flores, John Couwels, Amanda Watts, Rebekah Riess, Leyla Santiago, Gregory Lemos, David Shortell, Curt Devine and Paul Vercammen contributed to this report.JUST WATCHEDVideo shows demolition of remainder of Surfside buildingReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH (18 Videos)Video shows demolition of remainder of Surfside buildingStructural engineer explains damage

Since the collapse, Balboa says he has replayed that moment in his mind many times, wondering what he could have done differently to save more people, he said. Four additional bodies were recovered Tuesday, Levine Cava said. The victims of the collapse range in age from 4 to 92.With rescue
    efforts still underway, some families have asked to visit the collapse site, Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett said."Of course, we have to work around the rescue efforts," he said. "I think it would be very, very good for those families to again see the amazing efforts that are being expended on their behalf."
    Debris held for investigationSearch and rescue teams continue to work in the rubble at the site of the collapsed Champlain Towers South condo in Surfside.Meanwhile, more federal organizations are investigating why the building collapsed. Mayor Levine Cava said the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the US Geological Survey and the National Science Foundation are sending staff."NIST, our federal partner, continues to work closely with the structural specialists, with detectives, and the fire rescue crews on site, as the evidence gathering process is well underway," she said."They're capturing all possible insights from the debris and all evidence is being properly tagged and logged."'Tragedy beyond tragedy': Champlain Towers South was a catastrophe in slow motion All of the debris removed from the site is considered "evidentiary debris," Levine Cava said. The remnants are being sorted on-site, and any objects that can be distinguished are put in certain bins and labeled as to their exact location, the mayor said.The county has created a form for family members to document their belongings, which will be an active part of the investigation, Levine Cava said."The families are not reviewing what's come out of the site at this time, but we have photographs, they have their information, and as we move forward, we'll be attempting to do matching and releasing it to them as soon as we can, given the active investigation," she said.CNN's Rosa Flores, John Couwels, Amanda Watts, Rebekah Riess, Leyla Santiago,
