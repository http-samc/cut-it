# Cut-It FAQ

## What are we?
Cut-It is a software utility designed to make preparing evidence and resources for all forms of speech and debate significantly easier. It comes in the form of a Windows and MacOS utility that is free to use. The program was initially developed by [Samarth Chitgopekar](https://github.com/http-samc) (CTO) for Offtime Roadmap, LLC. However, it was open-sourced to enable collaboration and give the community a direct voice in the program. Sam also currently leads new development and manages PRs, Issues, and Feedback. This software will continue to live on as being completely open-source regardless of the Status of Offtime Roadmap LLC. No one authority within the administration can claim ownership of said software. Those who own paid portions of the project (eg. domains, hosted servers, etc.) are under no obligation to continue funding such resources if Offtime Roadmap ceases to exist. 

## How you can I use Cut-It?
We encourage everyone to download and use Cut-It (see [releases](/releases)). You are also free to download the source code and run the raw app.py file if you so choose (might be an option for Linux users). 

## How can I help?
We greatly appreciate any and all who are willing to grow Cut-It. We started this to make debate more accessible and fun, while also promoting best practices. There are 2 major ways you can contribute (aside from downloading Cut-It directly).

### Tell your team!
Seeing people use our hardwork is what makes it worth it. By spreading Cut-It, you help us acomplish our mission while also gaining the most powerful tool in creating and centralizing high-quality research!
